# Notification Page App

## Overview

This is a React application that displays a notification page. Users can see notifications, mark individual notifications as read, and mark all notifications as read with a single click. The app also displays a count of unread notifications.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build a notification page that shows a list of notifications with different statuses and allows users to interact with them by marking them as read. The features include:

- Displaying a list of notifications.
- Highlighting unread notifications.
- Showing a count of unread notifications.
- Allowing users to mark individual notifications as read.
- Providing a button to mark all notifications as read.

## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- CSS

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to manage state in React using the `useState` hook. I also gained experience in handling user interactions and updating the UI accordingly. Additionally, I improved my skills in working with arrays and mapping over them to dynamically render components.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Implement more advanced state management using Context API or Redux.
- Add animations and transitions to improve the user experience.
- Explore backend integration to fetch notifications from a server.

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This helped me understand the core concepts of React.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - A great resource for improving my CSS skills.
